<h1>Project overview</h1>

Tagline: Dharmo rakshite rakshitah — protect the right, teach how to protect yourself.

This project is a live-demo / educational stall that:

Shows benign, controlled demonstrations of common security concepts.

Explains how these tools work, what attackers look for, and practical steps to defend yourself.

Encourages ethical behavior and legal, defensive use only.

Note: This repo contains no harmful code. Any potentially dangerous demonstrations must be simulated, consented, and run in an isolated environment.



<h1>Quick Start (the simplest & fastest way to present at the stall)</h1>

1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/cyberDevansh/First-Year-Project-Completed.git

2. Create a virtual env and install requirements:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start the demo UI (simple CLI or browser page):
python app.py

4. Click the link and you will enter your website.



<h1>Why this project? (one-liner)</h1>
<b><i>Teach people defensive hygiene by showing how simple attacks look and giving immediate, practical countermeasures.</i></b>
